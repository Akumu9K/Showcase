// So heres the first function I made for this thing. Its an on and off state saver.
// It looks for a 2 specific iota, if it doesnt find em it just runs based on saved data
// if it finds them, it runs on that data and saves them
// This is an on off thing so you cant have “mode 1, mode 2” with this 
// but a modified version can very much do that

// The first 2 save those specific iotas, 3rd is for a “ram location”, a number basically
// 4th is a “ram location” one aswell, 5th is a specific iota one, specifically the “on” one. 
// And finally, 6th and 7th is for the akashic library access.
